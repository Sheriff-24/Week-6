⚡ Fun fact: Martin Luther King Jr. started college at 15.
My project idea is to develop an online module that can help patients choose the most appropriate over-the-counter medications for their health issues. My module will allow patients to input their pre-existing medical conditions into their profile. It will then analyze the conditions using advanced algorithms and clinical treatment guidelines to automatically generate recommended medication options. Patients will be able to see suitable drug names along with recommended dosages and usage instructions tailored to their needs. This customized recommendation process will guide patients towards the best medication choices rather than leaving them to search through options on their own for minor ailments. Conveniently, my module will also be integrated with the online pharmacy's purchasing system so patients can easily order the recommended drugs through the platform if they wish.
In order to create this medication recommendation module, I will perform thorough research on compiling common illness conditions and established treatment guidelines from respected medical organizations. Relevant drug data from verified sources will then be compiled into the system.
For coding the pharmacy management system, Java, C#, PHP or JavaScript would be suitable programming languages based on the application requirements.
